# Surface Management System

Create and use a ScriptableObject-based Surface Management system for your game! 

In this [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/kT2ZxjMuT_4) learn how this system works, and how you can use it to create new Surfaces, Impact Types, and even extends to more Surface Effects than just Spawning Object Effect and Play Audio Effect (that's all that's included!).

A common need in video games, to increase immersion of the player, is to add some effect when an impact is made. Using this system whenever an impact is made by any arbitrary action in your game, you can simply call SurfaceManager.Instance.HandleImpact() and this system will utilize Scriptable Objects to determine which effects to play. This allows you to have a highly configuration-driven surface management system where you can reuse effects across different impacts when that makes sense, and easily add/change effects when you want a unique effect!
